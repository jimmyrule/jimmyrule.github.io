Must I pay to host a website of my own creation?

Maybe. It depends. What are you trying to achieve?

Speak from experience. Have enough knowledge about you to string together a styled web page? Might you only need to put out in to the wild a static website? No, then. You don't need to pay for hosting. Or for that matter, to get the little padlock-y thing of warmth.

Wait. Three to nine other people I mostly choose to avoid have blackmailed me in to doing the same for them. Can I do that as well? I hope so, or the world won't get that quiche receipe for which they've been searching.

Yes, that's fine.

That'll do, pig. That'll do.
